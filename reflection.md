## What Worked Well

The FitBot RAG AI Assistant successfully implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation workflow using LangChain, ChromaDB, and HuggingFace embeddings. The assistant was able to retrieve relevant fitness knowledge from source documents and generate personalized workout recommendations based on user goals and activity patterns.

The preprocessing pipeline, feature engineering workflow, and recommendation logic worked reliably throughout testing. The project also successfully demonstrated conversational AI concepts, vector search, semantic retrieval, and memory-based interaction.

## What Did Not Work

Persistent long-term memory between notebook sessions was limited because the implementation primarily relied on notebook runtime memory. Additionally, retrieval quality depended heavily on the quality and organization of the source fitness documents.

Some advanced LangChain agent features required additional API configuration and occasionally produced inconsistent outputs when testing tool-calling behavior.

## Biggest Technical Challenge

The most difficult technical challenge was integrating retrieval-based workflows with personalized recommendation logic. Building a pipeline that could retrieve useful fitness information while also adapting responses to user goals required balancing semantic search, prompt engineering, and rule-based filtering.

This challenge was solved by simplifying the architecture into a single-agent RAG workflow and using structured exercise metadata to improve recommendation consistency.

## Architecture Changes

The original midterm concept considered a more advanced multi-agent architecture. During implementation, the project shifted toward a more stable and explainable single-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation system.

This decision improved reliability, simplified debugging, and made the final implementation easier to demonstrate and explain.
